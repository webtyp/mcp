# Plan: the `mcp` operation context follows the router Context contract

## Why (read once)

`webtyp.com/router` v0.5.0 changed the `router.Context` contract: `Path()` is the path only and the new `RawQuery() string` is the query (`"a=1&b=two"`, `""` when none), read with `router.QueryReader(ctx.RawQuery())`. This repo implements `Context`, so it stops compiling until it does the same. The contract is held by `router/conformance` (`Run` for transports served by a `Router`); a transport that disagrees fails it.

## Tools

```bash
go install webtyp.com/devflow/cmd/gotest@latest
go get webtyp.com/router@v0.5.0
go mod tidy
```
No `replace` in `go.mod`. If a module cannot be fetched, stop and say so in the PR; never write a hash by hand.

## APIs used

| symbol | exact signature | tag | file |
|---|---|---|---|
| `router.Context.RawQuery` | `RawQuery() string` | router v0.5.0 | `router.go` |
| `router.PathOf` | `func PathOf(target string) string` | router v0.5.0 | `query_codec.go` |
| `router.QueryOf` | `func QueryOf(path string) string` | router v0.5.0 | `query_codec.go` |
| `router.DecodeArgs` | `func DecodeArgs(method, query string, body []byte, into model.Decodable, fromBody func(body []byte, into model.Decodable) error) error` | router v0.5.0 | `query_codec.go` |
If a signature in the published tag differs from this table, stop and name the symbol in the PR; never adapt it by guessing.

## Stage 1 — `harvest.go`

`opContext` answers a tool call, which has no URL (`Path()` returns `""`, line 164). Next to it add:

```go
// RawQuery is empty: a tool call has no URL, its arguments are the body.
func (c *opContext) RawQuery() string { return "" }
```

Then run `go vet ./...` at the root and in `tests/` (nested module if `tests/go.mod` exists): every fake of `router.Context` in the tests needs `RawQuery() string { return "" }`; add exactly that method to each, one file at a time (`grep -rn "SetAssurance(" --include=*_test.go .` lists them).

## Stage 2 — tests and docs

| Test | setup → call → expected |
|---|---|
| `TestOpContext_HasNoURL` (`tests/mount_test.go`) | a tool registered through the mount whose handler writes `ctx.Path() + "|" + ctx.RawQuery()`, called with empty arguments → the answer is `|` |

Add its row to `docs/TESTS.md`. One sentence in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: a tool call has no URL, `Path()` and `RawQuery()` are empty.

## Delivery check

`gotest` passes (it builds, vets, races and runs every destination); the pull request is open. A tree that does not compile or whose tests did not run is a failed delivery.
